# AdviseU

## Overview

AdviseU is an application that generates an optimized four-year graduation plan based on a student's:

- Planned major(s)
- Planned minor(s)
- Completed courses

The system analyzes degree requirements and prerequisite chains to produce a semester-by-semester schedule that satisfies all academic requirements efficiently.

## Data Collection

We scraped course and degree requirement data from the UNL course catalog to build:

- Structured course data (credits, prerequisites, etc.)
- Major and minor requirements

This data serves as the foundation for generating accurate academic plans.
